### What I learned

shadow used in the card component

```css
.container {
  box-shadow: 13px 30px 5px 5px hsla(219, 54%, 9%, 0.5),
    -13px 30px 5px 5px hsla(219, 54%, 9%, 0.5),
    13px 30px 5px 50px hsla(219, 54%, 9%, 0.2),
    -13px 30px 5px 50px hsla(219, 54%, 9%, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

- mobile view needs some tweaking
- dekstop view need some review
